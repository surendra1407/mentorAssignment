Thread is a Sequential flow of control in a program.

There are few stages in a thread:
1)New 2)Runnable 3)Blocked 4)Waiting 5)timed waiting 6)terminated


New:- A new thread is created, but it has not started yet, it yet to be run by calling the start method.

Runnable:- once a thread is ready to run then its moved to runnable state.

Blocked:- a thread is temporarily inactive, then it’s in one of the following states: 1)Blocked 2)Waiting 

Timed waiting:- A thread lies in timed waiting state when it calls a method with a time out parameter.
			    A thread lies in this state until the timeout is completed or until a notification is received.
			    
Terminated:- A thread terminates because of some unusual erroneous event, like segmentation fault or an unhandled exception.


Non-Runnable states:-

Sleeping: The thread sleeps for a specified amount of time .
Blocked for I/O: The thread waits for a blocking operation to complete .
Blocked for join completion: The thread awaits completion of another thread .
Waiting for notification: The thread awaits notification from another thread .
Blocked for lock acquisition: The thread waits to acquire the lock of an object .
